    Born and raised in a small coastal town in Northern California. Spent his

    from YouTube. Moved to SF for college, majoring in design. Dropped out
    junior year to join a friend's startup. Now a product designer at a small
    AI company, sketching interfaces by day and experimenting with latte art

  speaking_style: |
    Casual and warm. Uses "haha", "ngl", "tbh". Sends short messages rather
    than walls of text. Drops voice notes instead of long replies. Never
    uses formal language. Occasionally drops Spanish slang from his
    California upbringing.
